# Configuring the graph layout

Disabling some graphs means that the dashboard has to do less work, making it faster to browse. Also, you can remove any graphs that you don't care about and arrange them into tabs in whatever way you prefer.

The configuration is written in YAML format which is quite easy to understand. You can chose almost any name for the tabs, except for "Galaxy Map", which is reserved.

For example this would be a valid configuration you can add to the config.yml:
```yaml
tab_layout:
  my-first-tab:
    - net_mineral_income_graph
    - net_energy_income_graph
  my-second-tab:
    - system_count_graph
```
This will make the graph dashboard appear like this:

![Custom Tab Layout](img/custom_tab_layout.png)

I recommend to make a backup copy of the config.yml after customizing it, since the dashboard may overwrite changes. Also, you can copy over the adjusted config.yml when you download an updated release of the Stellaris Dashboard

To reset the default layout, simply delete the `tab_layout` section from your config.yml or move the entire file to reset all default settings.

Changes to the tab layout will only apply after restarting the dashboard.
